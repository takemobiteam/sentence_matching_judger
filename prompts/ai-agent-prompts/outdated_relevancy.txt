Part Of A Outdated relevancy means that the tag used to mean something for the data point, but not anymore.
For example for tag jazz bar, if the matched sentence says it was a jazz bar 20 years ago. It implicitly indicated that it was a jazz bar "before" but it is not a jazz bar "now".

Judge if the assignment made a Outdated relevancy mistake
Output in the following format:
{
    "Was the tag a valid tag for the data point in the past?": <short reason and answer yes, no or idk, only say yes if the relationship on the past is explicit and obvious>,
    "Is the tag not a valid tag for the data point anymore now?": <short reason and answer yes, no or idk>
    "Answer": <"yes" or "no" yes only if answer for two previous questions are both yes>,
}
