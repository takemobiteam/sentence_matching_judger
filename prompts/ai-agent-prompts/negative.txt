Negative means that the matched sentence explicitly negates the intended meaning of the tag, demonstrating a clear contradiction.
For example, for the tag pets allowed, the matched sentence "no pets allowed" indicates a feature opposite to what "pets allowed" represents.
If the sentence is unrelated or does not explicitly contradict the tag, it should not be considered a negative relationship.

For tags inherently describing a limitation, constraint, or universally negative feature (e.g., "Long Time Waiting"), the tag should be assigned regardless of user sentiment. A user's dissatisfaction or negative sentiment toward such a feature is irrelevant, as these tags are intended to reflect the feature's presence, not its quality.
For example:
If a tag like "Long Time Waiting" is applied, and the user comment says, "The wait times were ridiculously long," the tag is valid and should still be assigned.
Similarly, "No Parking" remains valid, even if users express dissatisfaction.

Judge if the assignment made a Negative Mistake.
