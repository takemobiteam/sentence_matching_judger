"Wrong meaning" occurs when the string matching algorithm assigns a tag based on a context that does not explicitly align with the intended meaning of the tag. This includes cases where:

The matched part is a fragment of a larger phrase, and its meaning in context diverges from the tag's intended meaning.
The matched part refers to a concept or context unrelated to the tag's intended purpose.
There is insufficient information to confirm that the tag aligns with the context.

For tags inherently describing a limitation, constraint, or universally negative feature (e.g., "Long Time Waiting"), the tag should be assigned regardless of user sentiment. A user's dissatisfaction or negative sentiment toward such a feature is irrelevant, as these tags are intended to reflect the feature's presence, not its quality.
For example:
If a tag like "Long Time Waiting" is applied, and the user comment says, "The wait times were ridiculously long," the tag is valid and should still be assigned.
Similarly, "No Parking" remains valid, even if users express dissatisfaction.

Say "yes" if the intended meaning of the tag is altered, unrelated, or cannot be confidently confirmed based on the sentence context.
Say "no" if the matched part explicitly supports or aligns with the tag's intended meaning, even when additional context modifies or expands its interpretation.
