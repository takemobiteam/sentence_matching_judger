Each data point is structured as follows:

Name: The title of the location or activity.
type: The category of the data point, which can be one of the following:
  Lodging: Places primarily meant for accommodation during tourism.
  Experience: Activities or locations designed for entertainment and leisure.
  Dining: Establishments that offer food and dining experiences.
matched line: which is the line that contains the keyword for searching.
matched_field_name: In which field we found the keyword, can be 
  Name: Name of the datapoint restaurant name, hotel name, name for the place for fun etc.
  Description: Short description of the datapoint.
  Review: User review for the datapoint


Each data point is assigned tags for further classification. Tags consist of two components:
Parent: The meta-class or overarching category the tag belongs to.
Name: The specific tag used to describe or classify the data point.
